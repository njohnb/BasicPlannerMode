----------------------------------------------------- Tech Unlock In Map View ----------------------------------------------------- 

This mod will allow you to pre-plan and ghost build anything in the game while in map view, regardless of whether you've researched it or not.
❔ How to use: Press Shift+M to enable planner mode, then you can open the map normally and start placing any unresearched ghost buildings.
               Always remember to turn planner mode back off when you're done!
⚠️ WARNING: This mod will disable achievements.
❕ NOTES: Due to the mod's structure, all hand-crafting is paused while in planning mode. 
          Some map features are not available in planning mode.
