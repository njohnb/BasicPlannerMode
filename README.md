----------------------------------------------------- Tech Unlock In Map View ----------------------------------------------------- 

This mod will allow you to pre-plan and ghost build anything in the game while in map view, regardless of wether you've researched it or not.
WARNING: This mod will disable achievments, as there is no way to simulate research without unlocking all research and relocking
also, research tree cannot (or should not) be opened when in planning mode, as it will reflect that everything has been researched
